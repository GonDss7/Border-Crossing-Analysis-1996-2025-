📊 Border Crossing Analysis (1996–2025)

This project analyzes more than 400,000 records of U.S. border crossings with Mexico and Canada, based on official data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS).

🔹 Project highlights

SQL Data Pipeline → Data cleaning, staging table, deduplication, and design of a Star Schema (fact + dimension tables).

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) → Trends, top ports, category distributions, and anomaly detection (e.g., post-9/11 decline, COVID-19 collapse).

Data Visualization → Interactive Tableau dashboard with:

🌍 Geospatial map of top border ports.

📊 Category analysis (Trucks, Pedestrians, Personal Vehicles, etc.).

📈 Time series (1996–2025) with key historical events highlighted.

Machine Learning (coming soon) → Forecasting future border crossing volumes.

🔹 Key Insights

Over 70% of crossings are personal vehicles and passengers.

Mexico border dominates pedestrian and vehicle flows, while Canada handles proportionally more truck crossings.

Crossings peaked around 2000, dropped after 9/11, and fell dramatically in 2020 (COVID-19) with partial recovery after 2021.

👉 Technologies used: PostgreSQL, SQL, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), Tableau.
👉 Next steps: ML forecasting (Prophet / Regression) and advanced dashboards.
